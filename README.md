## Transport Problem

In this project, we try to work on [Time series](https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/practice-problem-time-series-2/) practice problem hosted by analytics vidhaya. This project was also used to explore different time series techniques and their application in matlab.

The final matlab file is [here](https://github.com/abishekarun/Transport-Problem/blob/master/transport_problem.m) for this project. This project got the score of 259.7795 and obtained 195th position out of 6519 participants.
